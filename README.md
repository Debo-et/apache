# Apache Hadoop Manager - Lightweight Command-Line Tool for Hadoop Clusters

## üöÄ Introduction

Apache Hadoop Manager is a powerful command-line utility designed to simplify Hadoop cluster management with terminal efficiency. Unlike web-based solutions like Apache Ambari, this lightweight tool enables administrators and developers to monitor, configure, and maintain Hadoop ecosystems directly from the command line. Optimized for performance and automation, it reduces operational overhead while improving cluster management workflows.
